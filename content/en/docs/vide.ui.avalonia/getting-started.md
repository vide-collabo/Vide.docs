## Prerequisites

All you need to get started is the dotnet SDK installed that runs with Avalonia.

* Node 18 + npm 8
* dotnet SDK 7 or greater

There are 3 major IDEs that have dotnet, F# and node support:

* VSCode with Ionide extension
* Visual Studio 2022
* JetBrains Rider

Vide for Avalonia doesn't require much more. You can either use it in an existing Avalonia project or in F# Interactive (FSI). So let's get started!
